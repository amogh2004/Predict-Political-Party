# Predict Political Party

## Description
Using the public data set of how US congressmen voted on 17 different issues in the year 1984, we try to figure out their political party based on their votes, using a Deep Neural Network!

## Built with
* [tensorflow](https://pypi.org/project/tensorflow/) - TensorFlow is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms (CPUs, GPUs, TPUs), and from desktops to clusters of servers to mobile and edge devices.</br>
* [Keras](https://pypi.org/project/Keras/) - Keras is a high-level neural networks API for Python.</br></br>

## Prerequisites
You should have [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) installed in your system. To install other required libraries, run the following command in the terminal.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
